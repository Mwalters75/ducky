# Ducky
A GTK app for developers to make use of Rubber Duck Debugging without a physical duck.
## What is this "Rubber Duck Debugging"?
It's simple; you get a duck, walk the duck through your code, and you'll find the invalid code! Ducky makes it more simpler without disturbing your workflow, so you wouldn't have to look away from the computer everytime you need to debug!
## Running
You have two ways to run: using `python3`, or without `python3`.
### With `python3`
```
python3 ducky.py
```
### Without `python3`
Ducky is chmodded out of box, but however, `ducky.png` is still required.
```
./ducky.py
```
